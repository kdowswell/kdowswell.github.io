## Quickly Create Ionic App

### Figure Out Your Idea
- Look at market
	- What other apps are there that you'd like to make better
- Review ideas you've had in past
	- Are there any ideas that you have that you have been wanting to make?

### 

### Primary Feature
- This must be the easiest thing for users to do in your app.
- This must also be the most differientiating feature you have to provide to people.

### Secondary Features
- Come up with a list of all of the other necessary features needed to launch
	- Settings page
    - User Login
    - User Profile
    - Misc Features that might support your primary feature
    
### App Name
- Don't spend too much time on this. Use name generator tools like [Business Name Generator](https://businessnamegenerator.com/).

### Logo
- I use Adobe Illustrator to create a simple text based logo for most projects. Then in later iterations will refign it to be more in line with my design.

### Colors
- Pick a color that matches your product energy and feel. Create mood board or get inspiration from apps in your industry
