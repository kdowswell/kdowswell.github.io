## Creating An App (From Idea to App Store)
I wanted to give a somewhat high level journey of my process creating apps. I will write more on how I implement each step, but I will include some information on each step listed below. You will see a number of steps before we get anywhere near a line of code. We want to avoid writing code until we are sure about a few aspects about our software. Let's begin!

I use OneNote and Miro for most of my steps below. Try them out or use a note taking app of your choice.

### The Idea
Coming up with an idea can seem like a huge obstacle to overcome. But breaking it down into simple steps can help!

- Is there a need for your product in the market?
	- You need to talk to target users of your app to ensure need is there.
	- Understand current pain points from target users.
- Solving a problem you have personally
	- You are already aware of the pain points and market options
    
### Design Questions
- How would you describe your target design solution?
- What are the features and personality of the product?
- Who is it designed for and activities it is intended to encourage or enable?

### Elevator Pitch

### Mood Boards
Get pictures, colors, screenshots, and more to create a feel of the product you will create.

Research Tools:

### Feature Planning
I like to use Miro for this step and list out all of my potential features. Then I will organize them using the **Feature Audit** template to focus in on features that are most important.
