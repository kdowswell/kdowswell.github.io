## Creating An App (From Idea to App Store)
I wanted to give a somewhat high level journey of my process creating apps. I will write more on how I implement each step, but I will include some information on each step listed below. You will see a number of steps before we get anywhere near a line of code. We want to avoid writing code until we are sure about a few aspects about our software. Let's begin!

### The Idea
Coming up with an idea can seem like a huge obstacle to overcome. But breaking it down into simple steps can help!

- Is there a need for your product in the market?
	- You need to talk to target users of your app to ensure need is there.
	- Understand current pain points from target users.
- Solving a problem you have personally
	- You are already aware of the pain points and market options
    
### Design Questions
- How would you describe your target design solution?
- What are the features and personality of the product?
- Who is it designed for and activities it is intended to encourage or enable?

### Elevator Pitch
Target Audience:  
Opportunity/Pain: 
Product/Service:

### Proto-Persona 
Coming up with a proto-persona is key to understand the ideal user for your product.

### Primary Feature
- This must be the easiest thing for users to do in your app.
- This must also be the most differentiating feature you have to provide to people.

### Secondary Features
- Come up with a list of all of the other necessary features needed to launch
	- Settings page
    - User Login
    - User Profile
    - Misc Features that might support your primary feature
